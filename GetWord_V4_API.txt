The EnableCursorCapture enables/disables text-capturing with mouse cursor.

bEnable
    [in] Specifies whether to enable or disable text-capturing with mouse cursor. 
    If TRUE, the text-capturing with mouse cursor is enabled. 
    If FALSE, text-capturing with mouse cursor is disabled.
Return Values
If succeeds, the return value is nonzero. If fails, the return value is zero.
Text-capturing with mouse cursor is set to disable by default. If you want to 
enable text-capturing with mouse cursor, you need to call this function, and 
pass in the bEnable parameter with TRUE.

);
/*
The EnableHotkeyCapture enables/disables text-capturing with hotkey. 
Text-capturing with hotkey is set to disable by default.
bEnable
    [in] Specifies whether to enable or disable text-capturing with hotkey. 
    If TRUE, the text-capturing with hotkey is enabled. 
    If FALSE, text-capturing with hotkey is disabled.
fsModifiers
    [in] Specifies keys that must be pressed in combination with the key 
    specified by the vk parameter in order to generate the WM_HOTKEY message. 
    The fsModifiers parameter can be a combination of the following values.
    Value 	Meaning
    MOD_ALT 	Either ALT key must be held down.
    MOD_CONTROL 	Either CTRL key must be held down.
    MOD_SHIFT 	Either SHIFT key must be held down.
    MOD_WIN 	Either WINDOWS key was held down. These keys are labeled with the Microsoft Windows logo.
vk
    [in] Specifies the virtual-key code of the hot key. 

Return Values
If succeeds, the return value is nonzero. If fails, the return value is zero.
Remarks

When a key is pressed, the system looks for a match against all hot keys. Upon 
finding a match, the system posts the WM_HOTKEY message to the message queue of 
the thread that registered the hot key. This message is disposed by GetWord 
component automatically. You need not to care about this.

This function cannot associate a hot key with a window created by another thread.

EnableHotkeyCapture fails if the keystrokes specified for the hot key have 
already been registered by another hot key.

Windows NT4 and Windows 2000/XP: The F12 key is reserved for use by the debugger 
at all times, so it should not be registered as a hot key. Even when you are not 
debugging an application, F12 is reserved in case a kernel-mode debugger or a 
just-in-time debugger is resident.

needs not to be called after successfully getting the captured string.

left
    [in] Specifies the x-coordinate of upper-left corner of the capturing rectangle in the client coordinates

pstr 
    [out] Pointer to a BSTR string that receives the captured string. 
prectlist
    [out] Pointer to a list. Each element in the list is a structure which contains six parts: (s_len, s_cursorpos, s_left, s_top, s_right, s_bottom ). s_len and s_cursorpos is a BYTE respectively. s_left, s_top, s_right and s_bottom is a WCHAR(short). Here s_len is the character count of the substring, s_cursorpos is the cursor position in the substring, and (s_left, s_top, s_right, s_bottom ) is the bounding rectangle of the substring in the screen coordinates.

Return Values

The return value is the total substrings' count in the specified rectangle (left, top, right, bottom).
Remarks

The following steps indicate how to use this function:

1. Let LONG N=GetRectStringPairs (hWnd, left, top, right, bottom, pstr, prectlist). So we get the total substrings' count N.

2. Loop N times. Each time use GetPairItem to decode each substring.

Each item in prectlist is a six-parts element  (s_len, s_cursorpos, s_left, s_top, s_right, s_bottom ), it has the following structure. (NOTE: The structure maybe changes in the future, your application SHOULD NOT decode this structure directly. Please use GetPairItem to decode this structure instead.)

In developments which don't deallocate string automatically, such as Visual C++, 
FreePairs should be called after successfully getting the captured string. 

In developments which deallocate string automatically, such as Visual Basic,
